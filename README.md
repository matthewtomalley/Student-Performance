# Student Performance Data from UCI ML Repo

Performing EDA and predictive modeling on this dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Structure

The project is organized as follows (this is from a template--will edit as project develops):

For now, all work is in eda.ipynb

- **`src/app.py`** → Main Python script where your project will run.
- **`src/explore.ipynb`** → Notebook for exploration and testing. Once exploration is complete, migrate the clean code to `app.py`.
- **`src/utils.py`** → Auxiliary functions, such as database connection.
- **`requirements.txt`** → List of required Python packages.
- **`models/`** → Will contain your SQLAlchemy model classes.
- **`data/`** → Stores datasets at different stages:
  - **`data/raw/`** → Raw data.
  - **`data/interim/`** → Temporarily transformed data.
  - **`data/processed/`** → Data ready for analysis.
